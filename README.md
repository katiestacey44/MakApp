# Abstract
The Mackinac building is used by hundreds of students everyday, and includes more than a few different departmants. Many of these students are freshman, not used to such a large building to navigate. Not to mention, the Mackinac building doesn't have the simplest layout of classroom to easily memorize and interrpt. The idea for our app is hoping to give student to ability to quickly navigate through the Mack. building and possibliy take away one more thing to stress about. A student would input their current location by typing in the classroom they happened to be closest and then inputing their dresired classroom to which the app will present a graphic and some directions that will show student exactly where to go.   

# Introduction

The app will utilizes linked lists of nodes that represent rooms within te Mackinac building and calucalte a path to give students direction towards their desired classroom.
